description: The outcome of the analysis in this project will enable us to answer some important questions of interest. In particular, which airport saw the highest reduction in air travel?, which paths have disappeared from the flight network due to the COVID-19 pandemic?, would it be possible to predict any future changes in the paths or links across the flight network, and if so, which links would be affected?. Have certain airports become more or less influential since the enactment of COVID-19 travel restrictions? Project will use air traffic datasets provided by OpenSky Network and will be implemented using Python and NetworkX.
